# eduke32
## Compilation
  ```
  $ sudo apt install libflac-dev libvpx-dev libsdl2-dev # Adapt according to your repos and package manager
  ```
  ```
  $ make
  ```
Then you'll get 2 new files: eduke32 and mapster32.  
You will have to put original DUKE3D.GRP from game or any compatible data file. Put it to $HOME/.config/eduke32/  
Also you can get [SoundFonts](https://github.com/wrightflyer/SF2_SoundFonts) for this port, as it can improve sound. Put it to one of the HOME directories, for example to $HOME/Music.
